    "## what is <strong>ATTENTION</strong>\n",
    "in a model to perform well, it should be able to focus on the most relevant parts of the input.which is called <strong>attention</strong>.\n",
    "for example in a sentence like \"A cat sat on the mat and jumped over the dog\", the model should be able to focus on the words \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\" and \"jumped\" and etc. By doing so it makes it understand that the actual sentence is about a cat jumping over dog not a dog jumping over cat or anything else.\n",
    "- it is essential for language translation models to learn how to focus on the most relevant parts of the input.\n",
    "- for exmple we are converting timi sanchai xau,bhai? to english it cant be you fine are,brother? but you are fine,bhai?\n",
    "- here needs attention mechanism.\n",
    "- now in transformers, the model uses attention to focus on the most relevant parts of the input.but before transformers,there used to be RNNs which are neural network + encoder decoder which encoder generated context vector and decoder used that context vector to generate the output.\n",

    "## now lets understand RNNs and How they work.\n",
    "1. RNNs are a type of neural network that is used to process sequential data.\n",
    "2. when a single word comes in encoder in encoder a hidden state is generated.\n",
    "3. and it continuously updated until the end of the sentence.\n",
    "4. then in final hidden state there is context of the whole sentence.which is kind of memory of the sentence.\n",
    "5. this final hidden state is used by the decoder to generate the output.\n",
    "6. the output is generated as one word at a time using the context which now helps generating better output.\n",
    "- But there was problem with this that the decoder would use only the final hidden state to generate the output. which could be a problem if the sentence is long.\n",
    "- to solve this problem transformers introduced attention mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Before Transformers there was Bahdanau attention which would modify the RNNs in which the decoder would use the encoder previous hidden state to generate the output.\n",
    "- for example there is a sentence like \"A cat sat on the mat and jumped over the dog\".\n",
    "  while decoder is translating word jumped,it may give attention to the word cat also whch makes model understand that the actual sentence is about a cat jumping over dog not a dog jumping over cat or anything else.\n",
    "- this is called Bahdanau attention.\n",
    "* upto now we have understood how decoding happens using the encoders previous hidden state to generate the next word.\n",
